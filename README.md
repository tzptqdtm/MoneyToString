# MoneyToString

##Тестовое задание в компанию Синергия

You work at a bank and have been asked to produce a system that takes a numerical monetary value in dollars and cents and produces its English equivalent - so that it can be printed on physical paper cheques.

The user should be able to enter a dollar and cents amount (no currency symbols or commas are required for the input) which is less than 2 billion dollars, ie. A number between zero and 2 billion with 2 decimal places.

The application will output the English words that express the number as a string of word (dollars and cents). The program should encode words exactly as you would say them in reading out the monetary amount.

For example - if the user enters **1357256.32** then the program should convert that to:

**one million, three hundred and fifty seven thousand, two hundred and fifty six DOLLARS AND thirty two CENTS**
